  <h3>SetPlayWin Licensing & Legal Disclosures</h3>

  <p>
    This website, all associated smart contracts, and all SetPlayWin NFTs
    are created and published by <strong>Digitalknuckles</strong> (“Creator”, “Designer”).
    By minting, purchasing, holding, or transferring a DigitalKnuckles NFT, you
    agree to the following terms.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Intellectual Property Ownership</h3>
  <p>
    All artwork, designs, characters, animations, metadata, names, logos,
    trademarks, copyrights, and associated intellectual property remain the
    exclusive property of Digitalknuckles.
  </p>
  <p>
    No ownership of intellectual property is transferred through the sale or
    transfer of an NFT.
  </p>

  <h3>2. License Granted to NFT Holders</h3>
  <p>
    Subject to continued ownership of a valid DigitalKnuckles NFT, holders are
    granted a <strong>limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license</strong>
    to display the associated artwork for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal, non-commercial use</li>
    <li>Display in virtual galleries, wallets, or social media</li>
    <li>Resale or transfer of the NFT itself</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Commercial use, sublicensing, merchandising, reproduction, modification,
    or derivative works are strictly prohibited unless explicitly licensed in writing.
  </p>

  <h3>3. NFT Secondary Sales & Creator Royalties</h3>
  <p>
    Certain DigitalKnuckles NFTs include on-chain royalty logic implemented
    through ERC-compatible smart contracts (e.g., ERC-2981 or marketplace-level enforcement).
  </p>
  <p>
    Any creator royalty is a <strong>technical feature of the smart contract</strong>,
    not a legal entitlement, revenue share, investment return, or security interest.
    Royalties are only applied if and when supported by the executing marketplace
    or protocol.
  </p>

  <p>
    Digitalknuckles makes no representations or guarantees regarding:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Royalty enforcement on secondary markets</li>
    <li>Marketplace compliance</li>
    <li>Future royalty standards or implementations</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. First Sale Doctrine & NFTs</h3>
  <p>
    The First Sale Doctrine may permit resale of the NFT token itself.
    However, it <strong>does not transfer copyright, trademark, or commercial
    exploitation rights</strong> in the underlying artwork.
  </p>
  <p>
    NFT transfers convey ownership of the blockchain token only, not the
    associated intellectual property.
  </p>

  <h3>5. No Financial Rights or Investment Intent</h3>
  <p>
    DigitalKnuckles NFTs are <strong>digital collectibles</strong> intended for
    creative, artistic, entertainment, and access purposes only.
  </p>
  <p>
    NFTs do not represent:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Equity or ownership in Digitalknuckles</li>
    <li>Profit-sharing or revenue participation</li>
    <li>Dividends, yield, or passive income</li>
    <li>Voting rights or governance rights</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    No expectation of profit is promoted or implied from the efforts of
    Digitalknuckles or any third party.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Regulatory Disclosures (SEC / MiCA)</h3>
  <p>
    DigitalKnuckles NFTs are not securities, financial instruments, or investment
    products under U.S. securities laws, including the Howey Test, nor under the
    EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA).
  </p>
  <p>
    NFTs are not marketed as investments, are not pooled, and do not rely on
    managerial efforts to generate financial returns.
  </p>

  <h3>7. No Guarantees or Roadmap Commitments</h3>
  <p>
    Any references to future features, utilities, experiences, games, or
    integrations are aspirational and non-binding.
  </p>
  <p>
    Digitalknuckles reserves the right to modify, pause, or discontinue any
    aspect of the project at any time.
  </p>

  <h3>8. Assumption of Risk</h3>
  <p>
    NFTs involve technological, regulatory, and market risks, including but not
    limited to smart contract vulnerabilities, platform failure, and market volatility.
  </p>

  <p>
    By interacting with this website or associated smart contracts, you assume
    all risks and agree that Digitalknuckles shall not be liable for any losses.
  </p>

  <h3>9. Governing Law</h3>
  <p>
    These terms are governed by applicable laws without regard to conflict of
    law principles.
